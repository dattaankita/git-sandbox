I dont know the exact date when we talk for the first time/ we heard about each other. But I know the date we started talking in regular basis(all thanks to Whatsapp). After somedays he said "I think our frequency is matching and when I talk with you It doesnt feel like we know each other for couple of days. I dont know we will be in a relationship or not , 
but we could be good friends." That time I thought he is crazy. After talking with someone how could say like that. You dont even know that person , not even met that person before.
One day he was drunk and he was keep saying,"I just want to talk with you only, no one else." that is so childish but he told me I behave like a child.
Its been 41 days we are talking.Today's date I can say he is one of the important part of my life. After I knew him , I'm just trying to become like him. I know no one is perfect in this world. But for me, he is perfect. When we started talking I knew only his voice which is very calm, which make me calm and give me peace. After seeing him, I could say he is the person for whom any girl can fall. I dont know what i feel for him is it love or not because I dont know what is love? Sometimes I got scared because he had experiences of good relationships , had good memories with them. So at some point there will be comparison and I know I will be the worst one. Sometimes I feel like to tell him I Love you, but I know I am a good for nothing so how will i make better memories.
